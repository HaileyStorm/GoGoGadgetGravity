ESlider sprintf labels to use exponential form (if large)

Update loop time -> speed, including >1x

checkbox for "exaggerate" size (increase minimum size, decrease max - but don't just cap, stretch toward at both ends and have middling sizes normal(ish))

add particle remove history method, get rid of logic calling history change events to clear it.

in qt gui, replace all manual statusbar.showmessage w/ calls to the method that does it

Move particle proxies to gui? Downside: have to recalculate them every DrawParticles. Perhaps guis.GUIEnabler could include a method which takes mass&charges and returns radius,r,g,b,a, and engine calls this when mass or charge changes & updates the values accordingly?

Implement fyne GUI frontend?

Implement GoGi GUI frontend?

If implement GUI that enables fast particle draws (no more stupid file intermediary), multi-thread physics.UpdateParticles etc., and possibly particle drawing itself depending on how backbuffer access and such work in the GUI

Move drawFilledCircle etc. from GUI to main (or CCSL)? (Note: drawParticles probably can't be moved as it's proxy dependent - and we probably want to move proxies to the GUI - and how history trails are drawn is also GUI dependent
